# bree-takehome

## to run the project on your local
1. clone the repo
2. `cd bree` in your terminal
3. run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. run `npm start` and the app will run on your http://localhost:3000/

## design, additional features
- following Bree's design themes with simple and clean interface
- For desktop and tablet, there is a sidebar to navigate between pages
- for mobile it is a bottom nav. I considered to use a burger icon, but decided this is more user friendly for mobile app users.
- I added feature of auto closing 3 seconds after the success message for requests for a smoother user experience.
- For the details shown when hovering on transactions, I designed it to follow your cursor for simplicity and clarity.
- I added a unit test to test on the error handling when user inputs >350. I belive this is a super critical component to test on.
  
## challenges
- To save time, I worked on CSS and jsx in the same file. If I am writing production code I would either write smaller components or factor out the CSS for styled-component in its own file and import it. If I'm writing production code, I would also spend more time to improve further on maintainability such as factoring out reusable component CSS.
